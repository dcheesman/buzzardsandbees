      <h2>Where do I pick up my festival wristband?</h2>
      <p>
        On Friday, the 26th you can pick up your wristband at The Boxcar (156 W 500 S Provo) during the Goth Prom kick-off party starting at 8:00 pm. Follow the signs.
        <br><br>
        On Saturday, the 27th you can pick up wristbands starting at 3:00 pm at The Bell Room, located on the northwest corner of University Avenue and Center Street.
      </p>
    </div> -->
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>There are a lot of performers, will my wristband allow me to see all of them?</h2>
      <p>
        With your festival wristband, you'll get into all of the festival venues for all of the advertised shows. You can come and go as you please. 
        <br><br>
        However, there are no guarantees, as many artists will be performing at the same time, and each venue has a certain capacity limit. If there is a band that you really want to see, you will want to plan ahead and arrive early. Also, the lineup is always subject to change (sickness, tornadoes, etc.).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>What is happening on each day of the festival?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Friday October 25:</strong> Goth Prom co-hosted by The Boxcar, 8pm-midnight. Bring a date and come dressed as your most depressing self because we'll be crowning Goth King & Queen, seeing a musical performance by Madge, and will dance the night away to beats provided by DJ KiD MACHiNE.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Saturday October 26:</strong> Starting at 4:00 pm, Downtown Provo will come alive at 10 different venues featuring 80+ bands and performances, secret shows, street performers, a costume contest, mask making station, spooky story-telling and much more.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>Where do I park?</h2>
      <p>
        Free parking is available in the parking garage next to Wells Fargo and Zions Bank on University Avenue. Free parking is also available next to the Provo City Center on 400 west and 100 south. There will be some on-street parking as well but that is pretty limited. For more parking options check out <a href="https://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=14993">this map</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>Can my band play?</h2>
      <p>
        Band applications closed on August 25. If your music works as street performance you can sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK_og0Z4S5SEdBYNH1TId_yStJPzBoceZSxLyb8wIbxrFViQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. We encourage you to enjoy the festival as an attendee this year and keep an eye out for next year's application!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>What is a secret show?</h2>
      <p>
        Every musical act performing will be listed on our schedule; however, there will be several secret shows featuring well-known local musicians with limited seating and in an unknown location. Keep an eye out for how you can earn your ticket to these exclusive shows.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- <div id="question">
      <h2>How do I enter the costume contest?</h2>
      <p>
        Simply put on your best costume, take a photo somewhere in Downtown Provo during the event, post that picture to your Instagram, tag @buzzardsandbees and use the hashtag #buzzbeescostume. The winner will be announced on Sunday, October 28, by 12pm.
      </p>
    </div> -->

    <div id="question">
      <h2>Is this a family-friendly event?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. We'll have shows and entertainment for all ages. ABGs is our only venue that will be limited to ages 21+.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>I want to buy tickets for a lot of people, do I have to pay for kids, and is there a discount?</h2>
      <p>
        Children ages 7 and under are free, with a paying parent/guardian. The ones that look to be around that age will need to have a wristband.
        <br><br>
        We do also have a bulk ticket option, in multiples of 10, for a 15% discount. Shoot us a message to get the code for that - DM us on Instagram or Facebook, or send an email to buzzardsandbees@gmail.com.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>Can I buy tickets in real life anywhere, or do I have to buy online?</h2>
      <!-- <p>
        We do have some printed tickets available for sale at Velour Live Music Gallery, on nights that they have concerts. Check out their schedule at <a href="http://velourlive.com/pages/shows.php" target="_blank">velourlive.com</a> . You can also pay in cash on the day of the show at The Boxcar on Friday or at The Bell Room on Saturday, though it will be $25 as opposed to $20.
      </p> -->
      <p>
        You have a couple options for buying tickets. You can buy them from band members (suggested). You can buy them at Velour Live Music Gallery during any show. Tickets will also be available the day of the show, but will cost $20 instead of $15.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>What do I need to know about food and drink?</h2>
      <p>
        At our Goth Prom kick-off party on Friday there will be food trucks outside (to be announced), and on Saturday there are many restaurants around and in between our event locations, so there will be plenty of opportunities to grab a bite to eat! 
        <br><br>
        For all of the music venues, no outside food or drink is allowed (water bottles are okay). Some of the venues will have concessions for sale inside, but not all of them. You'll want to plan ahead!
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
      <p>
        There are several ways to get involved. The biggest thing we need help with right now is to get the word out about our event! You can post on social media, invite people in real life, etc. 
        <br><br>
        We're looking for reliable volunteers, if that's you or if you know anybody who might be interested, the application form is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoYvBUs7EmhT1KNEwPgJhfc62OugLgFuoLn_49pNULWP7DXQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>.
        <br><br>
        We're also looking for entertainers, if you or someone you know might be interested in that, the application form is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK_og0Z4S5SEdBYNH1TId_yStJPzBoceZSxLyb8wIbxrFViQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>.
        <br><br>
        If you would be interested sponsoring the event, please send us an email at buzzardsandbees@gmail.com.

    <!-- <div id="question">
      <h2>Are all of the venues handicap accessible?</h2>
      <p>
        A couple of our venues have events that are not on the ground level, so it could be tricky or not accessible for those with mobility issues. Buzzards &amp; Bees staff are available to assist (we'll be wearing staff lanyards), but as a heads up here is the list of locations with things going on either upstairs or downstairs:
        <div id="venuelist" >
          <ul >
            <li>Provo Community Congregational United Church of Christ</li>
            <li>The Man Barber</li>
            <li>The Underground Social Hall</li>
          </ul>
