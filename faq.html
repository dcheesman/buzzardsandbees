      <h2>Where do I pick up my festival wristband?</h2>
      <p>
        On Friday, the 26th you can pick up your wristband at The Boxcar (156 W 500 S Provo) during the Goth Prom kick-off party starting at 8:00 pm. Follow the signs.
        <br><br>
        On Saturday, the 27th you can pick up wristbands starting at 3:00 pm at The Bell Room, located on the northwest corner of University Avenue and Center Street.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>There are a lot of performers, will my wristband allow me to see all of them?</h2>
      <p>
        With your festival wristband, you'll get into all of the festival venues for all of the advertised shows. You can come and go as you please. 
        <br><br>
        However, there are no guarantees, as many artists will be performing at the same time, and each venue has a certain capacity limit. If there is a band that you really want to see, you will want to plan ahead and arrive early. Also, the lineup is always subject to change (sickness, tornadoes, etc.).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>What is happening on each day of the festival?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Friday October 26:</strong> Goth Prom co-hosted by The Boxcar, 8pm-midnight. Bring a date and come dressed as your most depressing self because we'll be crowning Goth King & Queen, seeing a musical performance by Gossip Ghoul, and will dance the night away to beats provided by DJ KiD MACHiNE.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Saturday October 27:</strong> Starting at 3:00 pm, Downtown Provo will come alive at 10 different venues featuring 50+ bands and performances, secret shows, street performers, a costume contest, mask making station, spooky story-telling and much more.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>Where do I park?</h2>
      <p>
        Free parking is available in the parking garage next to Wells Fargo and Zions Bank on University Avenue. Free parking is also available next to the Provo City Center on 400 west and 100 south. There will be some on-street parking as well but that is pretty limited.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>What is a secret show?</h2>
      <p>
        Every musical act performing will be listed on our schedule; however, there will be several secret shows featuring well-known local musicians with limited seating and in an unknown location. Keep an eye out for how you can earn your ticket to these exclusive shows.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>How do I enter the costume contest?</h2>
      <p>
        Simply put on your best costume, take a photo somewhere in Downtown Provo during the event, post that picture to your Instagram, tag @buzzardsandbees and use the hashtag #buzzbeescostume. The winner will be announced on Sunday, October 28, by 12pm.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="question">
      <h2>Is this a family-friendly event?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Although the night is dark and full of terrors.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>I want to buy tickets for a lot of people, do I have to pay for kids, and is there a discount?</h2>
      <p>
        Children ages 7 and under are free, with a paying parent/guardian. The ones that look to be around that age will need to have a wristband.
        <br><br>
        We do also have a bulk ticket option, in multiples of 10, for a 15% discount. Shoot us a message to get the code for that - DM us on Instagram or Facebook, or send an email to buzzardsandbees@gmail.com.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>Can I buy tickets in real life anywhere, or do I have to buy online?</h2>
      <p>
        We do have some printed tickets available for sale at Velour Live Music Gallery, on nights that they have concerts. Check out their schedule at velourlive.com. You can also pay in cash on the day of the show at The Boxcar on Friday or at The Bell Room on Saturday, though it will be $25 as opposed to $20.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>What do I need to know about food and drink?</h2>
      <p>
        At our Goth Prom kick-off party on Friday there will be food trucks outside (to be announced), and on Saturday there are many restaurants around and in between our event locations, so there will be plenty of opportunities to grab a bite to eat! 
        <br><br>
        For all of the music venues, no outside food or drink is allowed (water bottles are okay). Some of the venues will have concessions for sale inside, but not all of them. You'll want to plan ahead!
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="question">
      <h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
      <p>
        There are several ways to get involved. The biggest thing we need help with right now is to get the word out about our event! You can post on social media, invite people in real life, etc.
